:european_castle: Design principles
-----------------------------------

_elucidate_ is a suite of tools intended to ease the transition from writing
academic findings in LaTeX to authoring in HTML, which has mature and
well-supported accessibility features that LaTeX and PDF cannot yet match.
The tools themselves are designed to be accessible, but, in the interest of
avoiding reinventing the wheel, some dependencies might be more or less
accessible than the site as a whole.

:octocat: Contributing
----------------------

If you find an issue with _elucidate_ &mdash; including accessibility of the
tools, content of tutorials, or issue with the interface &mdash; please open an
issue or pull request on GitHub, being sure to follow the
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

:art: Logo explanation
----------------------

The _elucidate_ logo is composed of the same piece of information, Euler's
identity, a famous and fundamental result of mathematics. The formula is
presented in the logo via LaTeX typeset math, MathML math markup, and a
verbal description of the result, written in Braille. The core message is
that there are many ways to present the same information, and that modern
accessibility tools should be used to ensure anyone can consume the result.

Incidentally, Leonhard Euler, who discovered the identity in the logo, was
almost blind in both eyes, with his eyesight deteriorating over the course
of his career. Help from scribes allowed him to continue contributing to
the mathematical literature. Euler is such a fundamental figure of math
that imagining the field today without his impact is impossible. Visual
impairment should never be an obstacle to full participation in any area
of STEM.
